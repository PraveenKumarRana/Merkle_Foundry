<h2>Question :</h2> <br>

The problem statement is, Mark uses results of some custom functions lot of times. He codes those custom functions himself every time. The nature of these functions is they take no input and  each of them give some output/returns output which is a string. Those functions are categorised on category A, category B, category C and category D after they are created.

Now he needs an interface on a single page where he can type code of those functions and when he clicks "save it", it appears as a button with function name on the button. The function/data should be saved in the browser memory or in the backend or anywhere in a file (upto you how you engineer the solution). He doesn't likes typing the same function again and this interface will help him.

Everytime a button is clicked it runs the function and displays it's output somewhere in that interface. By default the functions will go in category A. Those buttons will be displayed in four different buckets in the interface which will represent cateogru(it should look like 4 boxes or anything you can imagine). Mark can drag those buttons into different buckets, that is how category changes.

Now you have to code this system. Keep the interface simple, it should look simple and nice, don't spend too much time on design.

To code this system, you will need to write little code but will require good amount of thinking then only you will be able to create a good system. So think and do some design on paper and how you will do it and then only start coding. We will discuss your system design too. You are free to use language of your choice. Whichever language you choose Mark will write functions in that language format only.
